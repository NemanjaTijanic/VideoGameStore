# Video Game Store
**Introduction**

This is an app that I made during an university course with the idea of implementing everything learned during the semester. The program is an imitation of a digital video game store made using C# programming language.

## Specifics
**Use Cases**

Upon launching the program, the user is asked whether they already have an account or want to create a new one. If they already have an account, they are required to enter their username and password. If not, they enter certain details and create a new account. After that, they gain access to the store and can perform various actions, such as purchasing, depositing money into their account, and browsing the storeâ€™s products (either all products or specific ones through filtering).

There is also a role for the store owner, who can add new games for sale, view all customers and their purchase histories, and modify information about the games for sale.

**Structure**

The project represents a Windows app whose GUI is created using C# Windows Forms. A large number of classes and forms were used. The classes represent users, owners, games, recorded sales, as well as their corresponding CRUD methods, since all these classes reflect the structure of the database.

The application is based on a Client-Server architecture, and for this, a MySQL database was used, which was managed and accessed through phpMyAdmin and the XAMPP Control Panel program.

## Installation

Visual Studio version 2019 or higher is required (64-bit).

- Download VideoGameStore folder and SLN file.
